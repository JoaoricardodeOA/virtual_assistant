A Python-based voice assistant that can listen, respond, and execute commands in real-time. Built using SpeechRecognition, sounddevice, pygame, and other Python libraries, this assistant can search files, tell jokes, check the time, browse YouTube, search Wikipedia, empty the recycle bin, and much more.

### Features

Web search integration: Search YouTube or Wikipedia with your voice.
